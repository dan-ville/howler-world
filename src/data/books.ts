      "Darrow is a Helldiver, a Red miner working beneath the surface of Mars. He and his people believe they are the pioneers of humanity, sacrificing to terraform Mars for future generations. But Darrow discovers the surface was made livable long ago — and his people are nothing more than slaves to a rigid Color-coded caste system ruled by the Golds. After his wife Eo is executed for daring to sing a forbidden song, Darrow is recruited by the Sons of Ares, a rebel group. They Carve him into a Gold and send him to the Institute, the brutal training ground where young Golds compete for power. Darrow must survive the Passage, conquer rival houses, and prove himself among the very people who oppress his kind — all while hiding his true identity. Through tactical brilliance, alliances, and sacrifice, Darrow conquers the Institute as Primus of House Mars, earning the patronage of ArchGovernor Nero au Augustus.",

    synopsis:
      "Now embedded in Gold society as a lancer of House Augustus, Darrow navigates the deadly political landscape of the Society. He must balance his growing relationships with Golds — including his deepening bond with Mustang and his complicated rivalry with Cassius — against his mission for the Sons of Ares. The stakes escalate dramatically as war breaks out between the Great Houses and the Sovereign. Darrow rises to command fleets and armies, earning both glory and enemies. He recruits allies from unexpected places, including the Obsidian warrior Ragnar and the legendary razormaster Lorn au Arcos. But the political intrigue runs deeper than Darrow imagines. Betrayals come from the closest quarters — Roque turns against him, the Jackal plays every side, and a devastating trap at a Gala leads to catastrophic losses. The book ends with Darrow captured, his plans seemingly in ruins, and the revelation that Fitchner au Barca was Ares all along.",

      "Ten years after the fall of the Society, the Rising has given birth to the Solar Republic — but peace remains elusive. Darrow, now a legendary war hero, wages an unauthorized campaign against the remnants of the Society on Mercury, defying the Senate that seeks to restrain him. On Mars, a young Red woman named Lyria struggles to survive in a refugee camp, her family destroyed by the war Darrow started. On Luna, Lysander au Lune — grandson of the slain Sovereign — plots his return from exile with the help of Cassius au Bellona. Meanwhile, Ephraim ti Horn, a disillusioned Gray thief, is hired for a kidnapping that will have enormous political consequences. Told through four POVs for the first time, Iron Gold reveals that toppling a tyranny is far easier than building a just society. Old enemies resurface, the Republic fractures from within, and Darrow's reckless war on Mercury becomes a trap that threatens everything the Rising fought for.",

    synopsis:
      "The Solar Republic is crumbling. Darrow is stranded on Mercury after a catastrophic defeat, hunted by Atalantia au Grimmus and the forces of the Society Remnant. With dwindling supplies and shattered legions, he must survive a brutal guerrilla war on the sun-scorched planet. On Mars, Lyria is drawn deeper into a conspiracy that threatens the Republic from within. Mustang fights to hold the Republic together on Luna as enemies close in from every direction — the Society Remnant, Rim separatists, and traitors in her own Senate. Lysander arrives in the Core and begins his campaign to restore Gold rule, armed with dangerous charisma and a ruthless vision. Ephraim seeks redemption for his crimes but finds that the cost of atonement may be his life. Dark Age is the series' darkest and most devastating entry, as every faction suffers unimaginable losses and the dream of a free society threatens to die in fire and blood.",
